// Borrowing introduces aliasing.
// A reference can be borrowed from the owner

// To summarize, the usage rules for immutable and mutable references are as follows.
// For a value, there can be:
//   Either many immutable references.
//   Or one mutable reference.
// But not both at the same time.
//
// very similar to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Readersâ€“writer_lock
//
// another term for immutable references is shared references

//     let v2 = &mut v; //second mutable reference
//     v1.push(1); //error:cannot borrow `v` as mutable more than once at a time
// }

// If Rust had allowed a mutable reference and an immutable reference at the same time,
// the memory could become invalid through the mutable reference while the immutable
// reference could still be pointing to that invalid memory. For example, in the code below,
// v1 could access invalid memory if such code was allowed:
// pub fn why_mutable_and_immutable_reference_disallow_at_the_same_time() {
//     let mut v = vec![0, 1, 2, 3];
//     let v1 = &v[0]; //an immutable reference to Vec's first element
//     v.push(4); //this can invalidate Vec's internal buffer
//     let v2 = *v1; //this could access invalid memory live long enough

//     // see ../use_borrowed_args/arr_vec_slice.rs
//     // function --> heap_vec_dynamic_alloc
//     // when push in v, it may be reallocated v in memory!
// }
