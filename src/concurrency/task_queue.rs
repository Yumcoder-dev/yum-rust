// An event loop has one or more task queues
// A task queue is an order list of tasks
//
// example: see https://tianpan.co/blog/2015-01-13-understanding-reactor-pattern-for-highly-scalable-i-o-bound-web-server
//  To handle web requests, there are two competitive web architectures â€“ thread-based one and event-driven one.
//  The reactor pattern is one implementation technique of the event-driven architecture
